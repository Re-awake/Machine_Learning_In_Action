# Machine_Learning_In_Action (机器学习实战）
Machine_Learning_In_Action, Python 3 code

All code in the book are re-written in Python 3. The modification is based on the Chinese version of book （机器学习实战）. Some error from English version are fixed. The code running in cli are dropped down into separate python file. For two parts of cli command in same subchapter, two separate python file are made. (For example, there are two parts of cli commands in chapter 3_2_2. Two separate parts are written in 3_2_2.py and 3_2_2_2.py )

Original Code of the book are written in Python 2. Those source code can be downloaded from https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-in-action
